Thalamus is a vendor-neutral, Kubernetes-native inference service for sovereign LLM deployments. Weights, prompts, and context are protected and stay in the deployment perimeter.

Thalamus is built on [llm-d](https://llm-d.ai/), [vLLM](https://vllm.ai/), the [Gateway API inference extension](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension), and [Cortex](https://github.com/cobaltcore-dev/cortex).

Supports **Nvidia**, **AMD**, and **Intel** infrastructure.

**Full documentation** can be found on our [website](https://cobaltcore-dev.github.io/thalamus/) covering architecture, getting started, API references, and more.

Thalamus integrates natively with [CobaltCore](https://cobaltcore-dev.github.io/docs/), [Greenhouse](https://github.com/cloudoperators/greenhouse) and the broader [Apeiro Reference Architecture](https://apeirora.eu) ecosystem.

> ⚠️ **Status.** Thalamus is under active development. The value propositions and features below reflect the project vision. Not all of them are implemented today. APIs, CRDs, and chart values are subject to change.

## Value Propositions

- **Regulatory unblock.** Serves regulated and public-sector workloads that cannot use hyperscaler AI providers.
- **No vendor lock-in.** No dependency on a single hyperscaler, LLM vendor, or GPU infrastructure provider. Swap models and hardware behind a stable API.
- **IP and data protection.** Confidential computing keeps model weights and customer context inside attested GPU boundaries.
- **One stack, many targets.** The same stack runs in datacenters, sovereign cloud, and air-gapped satellite sites.

## Features

- OpenAI-compatible inference API with streaming
- Declarative model management via a Kubernetes Custom Resources including full lifecycle management
- Model-aware routing through the Gateway API Inference Extension
- KV-cache aware load balancing via the llm-d Endpoint Picker
- Autoscaling driven by time-to-first-token and queue-depth metrics
- Multi-vendor GPU support (Nvidia, AMD, Intel)
- Observability via Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and GPU exporters. Integrates natively with [Greenhouse](https://github.com/cloudoperators).
- Ready for air-gapped satellite deployments
